# Advanced-Scientific-Computing-using-Julia
Julia is a modern programming language, ideal for scientific computing, designed for fast, extensible, and reproducible code. In this two-day workshop, you’ll get hands-on: start with a practical example, create your first Julia package, and optimize your code while learning to achieve significant performance gains using Julia’s tools.
